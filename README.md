# Path Visualizer

1. This Project can help the users visualize shortest path finding algorithms
2. It contains visualization for A* search, Dijkstras, BFS, and DFS (Not a Shortest Path) algorithms 
3. It chooses the shortest possible path from start node (Green) to finish node (RED)
4. Shortest path is denoted by yellow line
5. The animaion helps to see how the algorithm chooses its neibhours or how it decides which node to go to next.
6. Dijkstra slways chooses the the node with minimum distance
7. BFS just see the immediate neibhours and move to it
8. You can also click on any empty grid element and drag the mouse to draw wall nodes and choose the algoithm to see how it works
